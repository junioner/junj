# Getting Started with Community Self-Help

## The Foundation

Self-help isn't about fixing yourself in isolation. It's about building capacity together.

## Three Principles

**1. Share What Works**  
When you discover something helpful, document it. Your breakthrough might be someone else's starting point.

**2. Learn in Public**  
Struggle and growth aren't shameful. They're the material we all work with.

**3. No Gatekeeping**  
Knowledge compounds when it's free. Paywalls create artificial scarcity in abundance.

## Start Here

- Identify one thing you've learned that helped you
- Write it down in a way that could help someone else  
- Share it forward
